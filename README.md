# Hard Park
This repo is only the front end of the project, you can find the sinatra backend [here](https://github.com/kadeesterline/phase-3-sinatra-react-project)

After cloning down both repos run the following commands from within the directory for this project: <br />
<code> npm install && npm start </code><br />

Instructions for starting the Sinatra backend can be found in that repo's README.

# About
Hard Park is a car meet for the internet where users can add pictures of their cars and interact with other users through comments and likes. Starting with the landing page, users are able to scroll down and jump to filtered sections of the lot immediately, there is a currently a sign up form at the bottom as well. There is no User model in the backend yet, making the sign up form a future to do and not a working feature yet. 

After clicking on the lot users can scroll through all of the cars added as well as filter through them and add their own car. 

Lastly for now is the form to add your own car to the database, until there is a user model users will need to provide an instagram username for the post. This is just a placeholder for now with the goal being to have a users chosen username shown instead of their instagram.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
